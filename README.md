# First Aid Kit Android application
An Android application that helps users locate their nearest first-aid kit, by implementing Google Maps and storing data on a cloud-based service provided by Firebase. It also focuses on a simplistic approach towards interactions for users using the application. The application employes a user-based system, where users can add and upload first-aid kits that they found. The locations of these kits then became visible to other users, who can use the application to find first-aid kits near to them. Currently,there has been no application or service available that stores first aid kit databases. The released application runs on Android devices with an OS version 5.0 and above.
