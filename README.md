# First Aid Kit Android application
This projectâ€™s aim was to create an Android application that helps users locate their nearest first-aid kit, by implementing Google Maps and storing data on a cloud-based service provided by Firebase. It also focused on a simplistic approach towards interactions for users using the application. The application employed a user-based system, where users could add and upload first-aid kits that they found. The locations of these kits then became visible to other users, who can use the application to find first-aid kits near to them.
